My name is Christina Ovezik (Χριστίνα Οβεζίκ in my native Greek), and I am a 
3rd-year PhD student at the University of Edinburgh. 
I am a member of the [Blockchain Technology
Lab](https://informatics.ed.ac.uk/blockchain) 
at the School of Informatics, 
where I conduct research on the decentralisation of blockchain systems, under 
the supervision of [Aggelos Kiayias](https://kiayias.com/) and 
[Daniel W. Woods](https://www.danielwoods.info/). 
My work focuses on evaluating the extent to which current blockchain systems 
are decentralised, by defining clear notions of decentralisation and 
developing systematic ways to measure it across different dimensions, as 
well as on designing mechanisms that promote and sustain decentralisation.
This research is a core component of the 
[Edinburgh Decentralisation Index](https://informatics.ed.ac.uk/blockchain/edi),
a project dedicated to tracking and comparing the decentralisation of live 
blockchain systems and providing a reliable reference point for the wider 
community.
Outside of academia, my interests include yoga, mindfulness, board games, and 
partner acrobatics.

<!-- I hold an MSc in Financial Computing from the University of Edinburgh and a
degree in Computer Science from the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki.
I also have experience working as a Software Engineer and Consultant in the
industry.  -->
